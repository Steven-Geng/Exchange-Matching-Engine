This is the instruction for scalability testing


For scalability, if you want to change the processor affinity, 
please go to the docker-compose.yml file under the docker-deploy 
directory and change the "0-7" in the following line:

command: bash -c "make clean && make && taskset -c 0-7 ./main"

You can change it to "0" (representing 1 core),
"0-1" (representing 2 cores), 
"0-3" (representing 4 cores), 
or "0-7" (representing 8 cores). 
Then, rerun "docker-compose up".

After running "docker-compose up", please open a new terminal, 
go to the testing/scalability directory, and run "./run_multiclients.sh". 
This script will simulate 10 clients simultaneously sending messages to the 
server and will ultimately provide the average runtime for each client. 
By changing the processor affinity of the server, you should observe different 
average runtimes reported by "./run_multiclients.sh".
