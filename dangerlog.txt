how to make sure that the children of a create/transaction are processed in the order they appear in the input. 
Former method: use separate vectors to store account and symbol
Setbacks: We can only store internal order in account/symbol.We can not identify order between account and symbol.
Improved method: Instead Of waiting after parsing all the request xml to generate the whole response xml, we parse 
each child element one by one and generate corresponding child in response xml. 
We use getNextCreate() to go to our next child.

2. 
Using a greater number of CPU cores doesn't necessarily result in faster performance, 
as it may lead to increased concurrent operations on the database. 
Since our database operations utilize transactions, this means that in case of conflicts, 
we'll have numerous attempts to rerun transactions, potentially resulting in prolonged blocking periods.
